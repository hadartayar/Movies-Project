# Movies-Project
In this website you can view all the series and movies that exists.
We worked with TMDB API.

In each series/ movie you can view its actors, all the seasons and chapters, the trailer, links to social networks, recommended series, similar series and more.
For each series/movie there is a specific live-chat you can join.

The users can add their favorites chapters from any series to their account, for a quick access. 
In addition we developed a recommending algorithm based on preferences of similar users.
